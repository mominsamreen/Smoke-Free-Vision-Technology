Image dehazing aims to restore the visual quality of images affected by haze, fog, or adverse weather, enhancing visibility and contrast. It removes haziness while preserving details, colors, and structure, producing visually appealing images useful for computer vision and photography applications.We propose an efficient method to remove haze from foggy images using boundary constraints on the transmission function. Our variable splitting algorithm restores high-quality, haze-free images with accurate colors and fine details. Experiments show the method's effectiveness and efficiency on various haze images.It aims to minimize artifacts and noise, producing high-quality, visually appealing images suitable for real-time applications like surveillance, remote sensing, and autonomous navigation.
